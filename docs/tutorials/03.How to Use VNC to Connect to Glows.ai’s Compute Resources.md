# How to Use VNC to Connect to Glows.aiâ€™s Compute Resources

Currently, some instances and images on Glows.ai support the VNC protocol, allowing you to access the graphical interface of instances using VNC.
You can download the version you need from the official [VNC Viewer website](https://www.realvnc.com/en/).

## **Step1: Create an instance**
When setting up an instance, please select the desired image. You can verify if the image supports VNC before proceeding.
