# Quick Start Guide: Running DeepSeek-R1 on Glows.ai

DeepSeek-R1 is a highly efficient AI model built upon existing open-source large language models, optimized and fine-tuned for enhanced performance. Developed by the DeepSeek team, it does not train from scratch but instead makes intelligent refinements to pre-trained models through meticulous fine-tuning and reinforcement learning techniques.

DeepSeek-R1 utilizes methods such as knowledge distillation, which compresses and streamlines model parameters to improve computational efficiency while preserving the core knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the original model. This approach allows DeepSeek-R1 to deliver powerful language understanding and generation capabilities while maintaining relatively low computational resource requirements.

As an optimized open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1 combines efficiency and flexibility, making it suitable for various applications such as text analysis, conversational AI, code assistance, and knowledge retrieval. It is adaptable to different computing environments, including cloud computing, personal computers, and enterprise-grade servers, providing a stable and efficient solution for AI research and business applications.

**Note:** Glows.ai provides two configurations of DeepSeek-R1:
**32B:** Optimized for efficient deployment and development on consumer-grade GPUs.
**70B:** Designed for large-scale AI-native applications. To utilize the 70B configuration, you need at least **2 Unit Qty NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs**.

## Step 2: Access to DeepSeek-R1
Let’s take DeepSeek-R1 32B for example. There’re two portals provided by Glows.ai.

1. **SSH Access (Port 22)**
- SSH provides command-line access to the backend environment for advanced operations.
- SSH Command: ssh user@<your-instance>-p22
- Password: Refer to the instance details in your Glows.ai dashboard.

2. **JupyterLab (HTTP Port 8080)**
JupyterLab serves as the interactive development environment for building workflows.
- Open the URL:
- plaintext
- Copy link
http://<your-instance>:8080
- Login credentials: Automatically set or provided in the dashboard.

## Step 3: Save and Apply the Results
1. **Export the output**
- The WebUI allows you to save the generated content directly to your local device for future use.

2. **Further integration**
- For large-scale text processing or seamless integration into your business workflows, use Glows.ai’s API deployment tools to incorporate DeepSeek-R1 into your applications or services.
